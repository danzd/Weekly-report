In the provided sqlite database is a table which represents the outbound calls made
by the system . Each record represents a call attempt made to a client with a call result indicating
the outcome of the call.
To help more easily monitor the ongoing collections performance you have been tasked to
create a weekly report. The report should
provide the stakeholders the possibility to monitor KPIs on an ongoing basis on an overall team
level as well individual agent performance level. The KPIs are monitored by stakeholders on a
monthly basis.
KPIs for the overall team:
● Connection Rate: Ratio of customers who answered call divided by all customers who
were called 
● Average Calls per Customer: Average number of calls per unique customer
● Number of RPC (Right Party Contact) Collection Calls: Number of Calls which we
consider as having reached the right party. (Calls with result "Agreement", "Already Paid", "Call another time", "Payment on the way","Refused to pay", "Return")
KPIs for Agent level:
● Promise Rate: Ratio of cases to collect with Collection call agreement divided by all
cases to collect
● Average Call duration per connect call with “Agreement”: Average call duration in
seconds where there was agreement
If there was more then one call attempt per day for the unique customer, count only one attempt
(the last one according to time of proceeding and its result)
